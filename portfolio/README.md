## Customizing Your Information

To personalize the portfolio with your information:

1. Edit `src/data/personal.json` with your details (name, bio, experience, education, etc.)
2. Update `src/data/skills.json` with your technical skills
3. Modify `src/data/projects.json` with your projects

The data will automatically populate across all themes, providing a consistent experience while maintaining the unique theme interfaces.

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
# For bash/zsh users
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

For PowerShell users:
```powershell
# Navigate to the project directory
cd portfolio
# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the portfolio in action.

## Next Steps

- Implement LinkedIn theme with professional styling and skill endorsements
- Develop Messaging theme with chat bubbles and conversation-like flow
- Create Game theme with pixel art and game mechanics
- Add more micro-interactions and animations for each theme
- Enhance project showcase with interactive case studies

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
