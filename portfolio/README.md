# Multi-Theme Portfolio

A creative developer portfolio that features radical UI metaphor switching, with four distinct themes that completely change the layout and interactions.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15.3.2 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Context API for theme management

## Features Implemented

- **Theme Context System**: A flexible context API for theme switching between Terminal, LinkedIn, Messaging, and Game UI metaphors.
- **Theme Persistence**: Themes are saved to localStorage for persistence between sessions.
- **Base Layout & Structure**: Foundational layout with theme-aware styling.
- **Theme Switcher Component**: An interactive UI element to switch between different themes.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes.
- **Sample Data**: Project and skill data with utility functions for accessing data.
- **Animation Utilities**: Theme-specific animation presets ready to use.
- **Terminal Theme**: Cyberpunk-inspired terminal interface with interactive commands, command history, and special effects.

## Themes

### 1. Terminal Theme (Implemented)

A retro command-line interface with a cyberpunk twistâ€”dark backgrounds, neon green text, and monospace fonts.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive command line with history navigation (up/down arrows)
- Command auto-completion with Tab key
- Authentic terminal boot sequence
- File system simulation (ls, cat)
- Project and skills viewing through commands
- Loading animations and typing effects
- Easter eggs and hidden commands (try `sudo rm -rf /`)
- Glitch effects and CRT screen simulation

**Commands:**
- `help` - Display available commands
- `clear` - Clear the terminal
- `projects` - List all projects
- `project [name]` - View project details
- `skills` - List skills by category
- `ls [-l] [-a]` - List "files" with optional flags
- `cat [file]` - View file contents
- `contact` - Show contact info
- `/crash`, `/matrix`, `/glitch` - Special effects

### 2. LinkedIn Theme (Planned)

Professional layout inspired by LinkedIn with cards and professional styling.

### 3. Messaging Theme (Planned)

Modern chat-inspired interface with message bubbles and conversational UI.

### 4. Game Theme (Planned)

Retro arcade game interface with vibrant colors and playful interactions.

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the portfolio in action.

## Next Steps

- Implement LinkedIn theme with professional styling and skill endorsements
- Develop Messaging theme with chat bubbles and conversation-like flow
- Create Game theme with pixel art and game mechanics
- Add more micro-interactions and animations for each theme
- Enhance project showcase with interactive case studies

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
